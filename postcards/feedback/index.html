	<ol>
		<li>I love the quotes you picked</li>
		<li>I really like that you identified which character says what using a different type treatment, but I think it gets lost slightly, particularly in the desktop version - I would either push it up a couple point sizes or emphasize slightly in a different way. </li>
		<li>The spacing between the character name and the quote on the Back to the Future III cards feels bigger than the other ones - could just be a slight optical adjustment</li>
		<li>I really love your typeface choice</li>
		<li>Not sure how to adjust this, but the back to the future I card its a little confusing because Marty's name is on the left while hes on the right, so if someone was unfamilliar with the movie they might think Doc Brown was Marty - maybe just reflect the image?</li>
