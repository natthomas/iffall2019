		<b> <em>[VERSE 1]</em></b> <br>
		My mother says I too romantic <br>
		She said "you're dancing in the movies" <br>
		I almost started to believe her <br>
		Then I saw you and I knew <br>
		Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older <br>
		Maybe it's all that I've been through <br>
		I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder <br>
		And how I see myself with you
	</p>

	<p class= prechorus1>
		<b> <em>[PRECHORUS] </em></b> <br>
		I don't say a word <br>
		But still you take my breath <br>
		And steal the things I know <br>
		There you go <br>
		Saving me from out of the cold
	</p>

	<p class= chorus>
		<b> <em>[CHORUS]</em> </b> <br>
		<em class= fireonfire>fire on fire</em> would normally kill us <br>
		But this much desire, together we're winners <br>
		They say that we're out of control <br>
		And Some say we're sinners <br>
		But Don't let them ruin our beautiful rythms <br>
		'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me <br>
		And look in my eyes <br>
		You are perfection, my only direction <br>
		It's <em class= fireonfire>fire on fire</em>
	</p>

	<p class= verse2>
		<b><em>[VERSE 2]</em></b> <br>
		When we fight we fight like lions <br>
		But then we love and feel the truth<br>
		We lose our minds in a city of roses <br>
		We wont abide by any rules
	</p>

	<p class= prechorus2>
		<b> <em>[PRECHORUS] </em></b> <br>
		I don't say a word <br>
		But still you take my breath <br>
		And steal the things I know <br>
		There you go <br>
		Saving me from out of the cold
